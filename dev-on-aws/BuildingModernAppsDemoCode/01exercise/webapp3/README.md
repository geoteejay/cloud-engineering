In this lab, you will continue to build the Dragons application in your AWS account. You will start by upgrading your application programming interface (API) and application to use Amazon Cognito user pools for authentication. You will then create the user pool and update the REST API to require authentication. Finally, you will deploy an updated version of the application, which sends the user to a sign-in webpage.
